# RDBMS Challenge - A Custom Database from Scratch

Hey there! 👋 This is my take on the RDBMS challenge - building a complete relational database management system from the ground up. I created both a sleek React frontend for managing databases and a robust Python backend that handles all the database operations.

What makes this special? I built the core database engine using only Python's standard library - no external database libraries at all. It's a full implementation that supports tables, relationships, SQL queries, and even basic indexing.

## 🎯 What This Project Shows

This is my implementation of a complete RDBMS from scratch. I built it to demonstrate deep understanding of database systems, SQL processing, and full-stack development. Here's what I tackled:

- **Core Database Engine**: Built entirely with Python's standard library - no external DB dependencies
- **SQL Parser & Executor**: Manual implementation of SQL query processing (SELECT, INSERT, JOINs, etc.)
- **Web Interface**: Clean React frontend for database management
- **REST API**: FastAPI backend serving database operations

The challenge was to create something functional yet educational, showing real database concepts without overcomplicating things.

## ✨ What I Built

**Database Engine** (Python/FastAPI):
- In-memory RDBMS using only Python standard library
- Full SQL support: SELECT, INSERT, JOIN, WHERE, etc.
- Tables with primary/foreign keys and basic indexing
- Manual SQL parsing and execution planning

**Web Interface** (React/TypeScript):
- SQL query editor with live execution
- Table designer and data viewer
- Schema visualization of relationships

**Demo**: Pre-loaded with departments, employees, and projects tables to showcase relationships and queries.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Prerequisites**: Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd frontend && npm install

   # Backend
   cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Start the services**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Backend
   cd backend && python -m app.main

   # Terminal 2: Frontend
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open** `http://localhost:3000` in your browser!

The app comes pre-loaded with demo data - try some SQL queries like `SELECT * FROM employees JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;`

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Database Overview**: The main interface shows the current database with available tables
2. **SQL Queries**: Click "SQL Query" tab or use the sidebar to start writing queries
3. **Table Management**: Use "New Table" to design custom table schemas
4. **Data Exploration**: Click on table names in the sidebar to browse data

### SQL Query Examples

#### Basic SELECT Queries
```sql
-- View all employees
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Filter by department
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 1;

-- Limit results
SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 3;
```

#### JOIN Operations
```sql
-- Employees with department names
SELECT e.name, e.role, d.name as department
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;

-- Projects with budgets over 50k
SELECT p.name, p.budget
FROM projects p
WHERE p.budget > 50000;
```

#### Data Modification
```sql
-- Insert new employee
INSERT INTO employees (name, role, department_id, salary)
VALUES ('Jane Smith', 'Designer', 4, 75000);

-- Update existing record
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.1
WHERE role = 'Engineer';

-- Delete record
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 106;
```

### Table Design
1. Click "New Table" in the sidebar
2. Define table name and columns:
   - **Column Name**: Identifier for the column
   - **Type**: Data type (INT, VARCHAR, DECIMAL, etc.)
   - **Length**: Size constraint for VARCHAR columns
   - **Nullable**: Whether the column can contain NULL values
   - **PK**: Primary key designation
3. Add/remove columns as needed
4. Save the table schema

### Schema Visualization
- Click "Schema Diagram" tab to view database relationships
- Interactive diagram shows tables and their connections
- Click table nodes to edit schemas
- Visual representation of foreign key relationships
